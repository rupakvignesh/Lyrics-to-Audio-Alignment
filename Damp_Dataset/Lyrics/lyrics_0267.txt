You with the

sad eyes,
don't be discouraged.
Oh, I realize it's hard to take courage.
In a world full of people you can lose sight of it all,
and darkness still inside you makes you feel so small.

But I see your true colors shining through.
I see your true colors and that's why
I love you!
So don't be afraid to let them show,
your true colors.
True colors
are beautiful

like a rainbow.

Show me a smile then don't be unhappy, can't remember when
I last saw you laughing.
If this world makes you crazy and you've taken all you can bear,
you call me up, because you know I'll be there.

And I see your true colors shining through.
I see your true colors
and that's why I love you.
So don't be afraid to let them show,
your true colors.
True colors
are beautiful

like a rainbow!
