I was so wrong for so long,
only tryin' to please myself.

Girl, I was caught up in her lust.
When I don't really want no one else.

So, no,
I know I should have treated you better,

but me and you were meant to last forever.
So let me in,
give me another chance
to really be your man!
'Cause when the roof caved in and the truth came out
I just didn't know what to do.
But when I become a star we'll be living so large,
I'll do anything for you.

So tell me, girl...

Whatcha say? Whatcha say?


Whatcha say? Whatcha say?

How could I live with myself
knowing that I let our love go?

And ooh, when I do with one chance
I just gotto let you know.

I know what I did wasn't clever,

but me and you were meant to be together.
So let me in,
give me another chance
to really be your man!
'Cause when the roof caved in and the truth came out
I just didn't know what to do.
But when I become a star, we'll be living so large,
I'll do anything for you!
So tell me, girl...


Whatcha say? Whatcha say?


Whatcha say? Whatcha say?

Girl, tell me whatcha said,
I don't want you to leave me.
Though you caught me cheating,
tell me, tell me whatcha said!
I really need you in my life 'cause
things ain't right, girl.
Tell me, tell me whatcha said.
I don't want you to leave me,
though you caught me cheating.
Tell me, tell me whatcha said!
I really need you in my life 'cause
things ain't riiiiiiight!
I just didn't know what to do...

So, baby, whatcha saaaaaay?

Well, of course I did.
Ohh, Well, of course it is.

Ooh, ohhh  .
Woah, oh, ohh.

Whatcha say? Whatcha say?
