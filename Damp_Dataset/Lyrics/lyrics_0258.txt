If you were falling,
then I would catch you.
You need a light,
I'd find a match.

'Cause I love the way you say, "Good morning."
And you take me the way I am.

If you are chilly,
here, take my sweater.
Your head is aching,
I'll make it better.

'Cause I love the way you call me, "Baby."
And you take me the way I am.

I'd buy you Rogaine,
when you start losing all your hair.
Sew on patches,
to all you tear.

'Cause I love you more than I could ever promise.
And you take me the way I am.
You take me the way I am.

You take me the way I am.
