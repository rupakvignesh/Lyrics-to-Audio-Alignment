When a man loves a woman,
can't keep his mind on nothing else.
He'll trade the world for the good thing he's found.
If she is bad, he can't see it,
she can do no wrong.
Turn his back on his best friend if he put her down.
When a man loves a woman,
spend his very last dime
tryin' to hold on to what he needs.
He'd give up all of his comforts,
sleep out in the rain.
If she said that's the way it ought to be.
Well, this man loves a woman,
I gave you everything I had
tryin' to hold on to your high class love.
Baby, please don't treat me bad.
When a man loves a woman,
down deep in his soul
she can bring him such misery.
If she has played him for a fool,
he's the last one to know.
Lovin' eyes can't ever see.
When a man loves a woman,
he can do her no wrong,
he can never own some other girl.
Yes, when a man loves a woman,
I know exactly how he feels.
'Cause baby, baby, baby, you're my world.
