At last,

My love has come along.

My lonely days are over.

And life is like a song.
Oh, yeah, yeah.

At last,

the skies above are blue.

My heart was wrapped up in clover

the night I looked at you.

And I found a dream
that I could speak to.
A dream that I can call my own.
I found a thrill to press my
cheek to.
A thrill that I have never known.
Oh, yeah, yeah.

You smiled,
you smiled.

Oh, and then the spell was cast.
And here we are

in heaven.
For you are mine...

at last.
