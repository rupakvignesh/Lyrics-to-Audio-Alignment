Start spreadin' the news,
I'm leavin' today.
I want to be a part of it,
New York, New York.
These vagabond shoes,
they're longin' to stray.
Right through the very heart of it,
New York, New York.
I wanna wake up in a city that doesn't sleep.
And find I'm king of the hill,
top of the heap.
These little town blues,
are melting away.
I'll make a brand new start of it,
in old New York.
If I can make it there, I'll make it,
anywhere.
It's up to you,
New York, New York.
New York, New York.
I want to wake up,
in a city that never sleeps.
And find I'm A-number-one,
top of the list,
king of the hill,
A-number-one!
These little town blues,
are melting away.
I'm gonna make a brand new start of it,
in old New York.
And if I can make it there,
I'm gonna make it anywhere.
It's up to you,
New York, New York!
New Yoooooorrrk!
