Woah oh oh.
Woah oh oh.
Woah oh oh.
Woah...

I'm waking up to ash and dust, I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust.
I'm breathing in the chemicals.
'Gasp...' aaah!

I'm breaking in, shaping up, then checking out on the prison bus.
This is it, the apocalypse, oh woah oh.
I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones.
Enough to make my system blow.
Welcome to the new age, to the new age.
Welcome to the new age, to the new age.

Woah oh oh oh, woah oh oh oh, I'm radioactive, radioactive.
Woah oh oh oh, woah oh oh oh, I'm radioactive, radioactive.

I raise my flag, don my clothes, it's a revolution, I suppose.
I'm painted red to fit right in, oh woah oh.

I'm breaking in, shaping up, then checking out on the prison bus.
This is it, the apocalypse, oh woah oh.
I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones.
Enough to make my system blow.
Welcome to the new age, to the new age.
Welcome to the new age, to the new age.

Woah oh oh oh, woah oh oh oh, I'm radioactive, radioactive.
Woah oh oh oh, woah oh oh oh, I'm radioactive, radioactive.

All systems go, the sun hasn't died.
Deep in my bones, straight from inside.
I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones.
Enough to make my system blow.
Welcome to the new age, to the new age.
Welcome to the new age, to the new age.

Woah oh oh oh, woah oh oh oh, I'm radioactive, radioactive.
Woah oh oh oh, woah oh oh oh, I'm radioactive, radioactive.
