Look at this stuff,
isn't it neat?
Wouldn't you think my collection's complete?
Wouldn't you think I'm the girl,
the girl who has everything?

Look at this trove,
treasures untold.
How many wonders can one cavern hold?
Lookin' around here you'd think,
'Sure, she's got everything!'
I've got gadgets and gizmos a-plenty.
I've got whozits and whatzits galore.
You want thingamabobs?
I've got twenty!
But who cares?
No big deal,
I want moooore!
I wanna be where the people are!
I wanna see, wanna see 'em dancin',
walkin' around on those...
What do you call 'em?
Oh... feet!
Flippin' your fins, you don't get too far.
Legs are required for jumpin' dancin',
strollin' along down a...
What's that word again?
Street!

Up where they walk, up where they run,
up where they stay all day in the sun!
Wanderin' free,
wish I could be
part of that world!

What would I give if I could live out of these waters?
What would I pay to spend a day warm on the sand?
Bet'cha on land they understand
that they don't reprimand their daughters.
Bright young women
sick of swimmin',
ready to staaaaaaand!
And ready to know what the people know.
Ask 'em my questions and get some answers.
What's a fire and why does it...
What's the word?
Buuurrrn!

When's it my turn?
Wouldn't I love,
love to explore that world up aboooooove?
Out of the sea,
wish I could be

part of that woooooooooorld!
