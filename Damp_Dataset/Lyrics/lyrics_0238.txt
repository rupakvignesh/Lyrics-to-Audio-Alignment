Guess it's true, I'm not good at a one-night stand.
But I still need love, 'cause I'm just a man.
These nights never seem to go to plan.
I don't want you to leave, will you hold my hand?
Oh, won't you,
stay with me?
'Cause you're,
all I need.
This ain't love, it's clear to see.
But darling,
stay with me.
Why am I so emotional?
No, it's not a good look, gain some self-control.
Deep down I know this never works.
But you can lay with me so it doesn't hurt.
Oh, won't you,
stay with me?
'Cause you're,
all I need.
This ain't love, it's clear to see.
But darling,
stay with me.
Ooh.
Ahh.
Whoa.
Mmm, mmm, mmm.
Oh, won't you,
stay with me?
'Cause you're,
all I need.
This ain't love, it's clear to see.
But darling, stay with me.
Oh, won't you,
stay with me?
'Cause you're,
all I need.
This ain't love, it's clear to see.
But darling,
stay with me.
