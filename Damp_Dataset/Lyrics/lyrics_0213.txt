She packed my bags last night, pre-flight.
Zero hour, 9 A.M.
And I'm gonna be high... as a kite by then.
I miss the earth so much,
I miss my wife.
It's lonely out in space.
On such a timeless flight.
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'til touch down brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home,
oh no, no, no.
I'm a rocket man.
Rocket man, burning out his fuse up here alone.
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'til touch down brings me 'round again to find...
I'm not the man they think I am at home,
oh no, no, no.
I'm a rocket man.
Rocket man, burning out his fuse up here alone.
Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids.
In fact, it's cold as hell.
And there's no one there to raise them
if you did.
And all this science
I don't understand.
It's just my job
five days a week.
A rocket man,
a rocket man.
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'til touch down brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home,
oh no, no, no.
I'm a rocket man.
Rocket man, burning out his fuse up here alone.
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'til touch down brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home,
oh no, no, no.
I'm a rocket man.
Rocket man, burning out his fuse up here alone.
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time.
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time.
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time.
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time.
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time.
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time.
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time.
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time.
