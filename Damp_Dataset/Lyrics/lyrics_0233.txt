For you,
there'll be no crying.
For you,
the sun will be shining.
'Cause I feel that when I'm with you,
it's alright,
I know it's alright.
And the songbirds keep singing like they
know the score,
and I love you, I love you, I love you.
Like never before.
To you,
I would give the world.
To you,
I'd never be cold.
'Cause I feel that when I'm with you,
it's alright,
I know it's right.
And the songbirds keep singing like they
know the score,
and I love you, I love you, I love you.
Like never before.
Like never before.
Like never before.
