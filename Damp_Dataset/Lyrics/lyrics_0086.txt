I can't light
no more of your darkness.
All my pictures
seem to fade to black and white.

I'm growing tired,
and time stands still before me,
frozen here
on the ladder of my life.
Too late
to save myself from falling,
I took a chance
and changed your way of life.
But you misread
my meaning when I met you.
Closed the door
and left me blinded
by the light.

Don't let the sun go down on me.
Although I search myself,
it's always someone else I see.
I'd just allow a fragment of your life
to wander free.
But losing everything

is like the sun going down on me.

I can't find,
oh, the right romantic line.
But see me once
and see the way I feel.

Don't discard me
just because you think I mean you harm.
But these cuts I have,
oh, they need love
to help them heal.

Don't let the sun go down on me.
Although I search myself,
it's always someone else I see.
I'd just allow a fragment of your life
to wander free.
But losing everything

is like the sun going down on me.

Don't let the sun
go down on me.
Although I search myself,
it's always someone else I see.
I'd just allow a fragment of your life
to wander free, yeah, yeah.
But losing everything

is like the sun going down on me.
