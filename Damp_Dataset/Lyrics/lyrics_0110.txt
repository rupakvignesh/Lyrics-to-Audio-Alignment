The sun goes down, the stars come out.
And all that counts is here and now.
My universe will never be the same,
I'm glad you came

You cast a spell on me, spell on me.
You hit me like the sky fell on me, fell on me.

And I decided you look well on me, well on me.
So let's go somewhere no one else can see, you and me.
And turn the lights out now.
Now I'll take you by the hand.
Hand you another drink,
drink it if you can.
Can you spend a little time?
Time is slippin' away.
Away from us, so stay.
Stay with me, I can make

Make you glad you came.
The sun goes down, the stars come out.

And all that counts is here and now.
My universe will never be the same,
I'm glad you came.

I'm glad you came.

I'm glad you came.
Oh oh oh oh,
oh oh oh oh.
Oh oh oh oh,

I'm glad you came,
Oh oh oh oh,
oh oh oh oh.
Oh oh oh oh,

so glad you came.
Oh oh oh oh,
oh oh oh oh.
Oh oh oh oh,

I'm glad you came
Oh oh oh oh,

Oh oh oh oh,

I'm glad you came
