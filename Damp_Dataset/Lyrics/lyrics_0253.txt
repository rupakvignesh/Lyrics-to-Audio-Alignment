I believe that children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be
Everybody's searchin' for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow
If I fail, if I succeed, at least I live as I believe
No matter what they take from me, they can't take away my dignity
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all inside of me
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself, it is the greatest love of all
I believe that children are our future

The greatest love of all is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself, it is the greatest love of all
And if by chance that special place that you've been dreaming of
Leads you to a lonely place, find your strength in love
