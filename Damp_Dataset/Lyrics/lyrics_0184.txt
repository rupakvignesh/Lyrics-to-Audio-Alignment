Greeting cards have all been sent,
the Christmas rush is through.
But I still have one wish to make,
a special one for you...
Merry Christmas, darling,
we're apart, that's true.
But I can dream, and in my dreams,
I'm Christmasing with you.
Holidays are joyful,
there's always something new.
But every day's a holiday
when I'm near to you.
The lights on my tree, I wish you could see,
I wish it every day.
The logs on the fire fill me with desire
to see you and to say...
That I wish you Merry Christmas,
happy new year, too.
I've just one wish on this Christmas Eve,
I wish I were with you.
