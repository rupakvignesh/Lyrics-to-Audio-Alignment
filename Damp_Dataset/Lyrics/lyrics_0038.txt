Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

I will not make the same mistakes that you did,
I... will not let myself cause my heart so much misery.
I will not break the way you did, you fell so hard.
I've learned the hard way, to never let it get that far.

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk.
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt.
Because of you
I find it hard to trust, not only me, but everyone around me,
because of you...
I am afraid.

I lose my way, and it's not too long before you point it out.
I cannot cry, because I know that's weakness in your eyes.
I'm forced to fake, a smile, a laugh, every day of my life.
My heart can't possibly break when it wasn't even whole to start with.

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk.
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt.
Because of you
I find it hard to trust, not only me, but everyone around me,
because of you...
I am afraid.

I watched you die, I heard you cry every night in your sleep.
I was so young, you should have known better than to lean on me.
You never thought of anyone else, you just saw your pain.
And now I cry in the middle of the night
for the same damn thing!

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk.
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt.

Because of you
I try my hardest just to forget everything.
Because of you
I don't know how to let anyone else in.
Because of you
I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty.
Because of you!
I am afraid.

Because of you...
Because of you...
