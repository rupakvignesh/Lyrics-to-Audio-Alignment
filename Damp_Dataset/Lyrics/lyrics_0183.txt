
It's a beautiful night, we're lookin' for something dumb to do
Hey baby, I think I wanna marry you


Is it the look in your eyes, or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares baby, I think I wanna marry you


Well I know this little chapel on the boulevard we can go
No one will know
Oh come on, girl


Who cares if we're trashed, got a pocket full of cash we can blow
Shots of Patron, and it's on, girl
Don't say no, no, no-no, no
Just say yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah
And we'll go, go, go-go, go
If you're ready, like I'm ready


'Cause it's a beautiful night, we're lookin' for something dumb to do
Hey baby, I think I wanna marry you


Is it the look in your eyes, or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares baby, I think I wanna marry you


Oh, I'll go get a ring, let the choir bells sing like oooooh
So what you wanna do?
Let's just run, girl


If we wake up and you wanna break up, that's cool
No I won't blame you, it was fun, girl
Don't say no, no, no-no, no
Just say yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah
And we'll go, go, go-go, go
If you're ready, like I'm ready


'Cause it's a beautiful night, we're lookin' for something dumb to do
Hey baby, I think I wanna marry you


Is it the look in your eyes, or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares baby, I think I wanna marry you

Just say I do, ooh-hoo
Tell me right now baby
Tell me right now baby, baby
Just say I do, ooh-hoo
Tell me right now baby
Tell me right now baby, baby


Oh, it's a beautiful night, we're lookin' for something dumb to do
Hey baby, I think I wanna marry you


Is it the look in your eyes, or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares baby, I think I wanna marry you
