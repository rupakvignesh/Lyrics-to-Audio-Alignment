Mama told me, when I was young:
'Come sit beside me, my only son.
And listen closely to what I say.
And if you do this, it'll help you some sunny day.'
Oh yeah.
'Oh, take your time, don't live too fast.
Troubles will come, and they will pass.
You'll find a woman, yeah, and you'll find love.
And don't forget son, there is someone up above.
And be a simple kind of man.
Oh be something you love and understand.
Baby, be a simple kind of man.
Oh won't you do this, for me son,
if you can.
Forget your lust, for the rich man's gold.
All that you need is in your soul.
And you can do this, oh baby, if you try.
All that I want for you, my son, is to be satisfied...
And be a simple kind of man.
Oh be something you love and understand.
Baby, be a simple kind of man.
Oh won't you do this, for me son,
if you can.'
Oh yes I will.
'Boy don't you worry, you'll find yourself.
Follow your heart, and nothing else.
You can do this, oh baby,
if you try.
All that I want for you, my son, is to be satisfied...
And be a simple kind of man.'
Oh yeah.
'Oh be something you love and understand.
Baby, be a simple kind of man.
Oh won't you do this, for me son, if you can.
Baby, be a simple,
be a simple man.
Oh be something,
you love and understand.
Baby, be a simple kind of man.
Oh won't you do this, for me son,
you can.'
