Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me, I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed.
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb in the shape of an "L" on her forehead.
Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming,
fed to the rules and I hit the ground running.
Didn't make sense not to live for fun,

Hey now, you're an all star,
get your game on, go play.
Hey now, you're a rock star,
get the show on, get paid.
All that glitters is gold,

All that glitters is gold,
only shooting stars...
Somebody once asked, could I spare some change for gas, "I need to get myself away from this place."
I said yep,
what a concept.
I could use a little fuel myself,
and we could all use a little chaaange.
