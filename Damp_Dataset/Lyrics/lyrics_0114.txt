Easy come, easy go,
that's just how you live.
Oh, take, take, take it all,
but you never give.

Should've known you was trouble from the first kiss,
had your eyes wide open.
Why were they open?
Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash.
You tossed it in the trash, you did.
To give me all your love, is all I ever asked.
'Cause what you don't understand is

I'd catch a grenade for you,
throw my hand on a blade for you.
I'd jump in front of a train for you.
You know I'd do anything for you.
Oh, oh, oh, I would go through all this pain,
take a bullet straight through my brain.
Yes, I would die for you, baby.
But you won't do the same.

No, no, no, no.

Black, black, black and blue,
beat me 'til I'm numb.
Tell the devil I said, ''Hey,'' when you get back to where you're from.

Mad woman, bad woman,
that's just what you are.
Yeah, you smile in my face then rip the brakes out my car.
Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash.
You tossed it in the trash, you did.
To give me all your love, is all I ever asked.

'Cause what you don't understand is I'd catch a grenade for you,
throw my hand on a blade for you.
I'd jump in front of a train for you.
You know I'd do anything for you.
Oh, oh, oh, I would go through all this pain,
take a bullet straight through my brain.
Yes, I would die for you, baby.
But you won't do the same.

If my body was on fire,
oooh, you'd watch me burn down in flames.
You said you loved me,
you're a liar,
'cause you never, ever, ever did, baby.

But darlin' I'd still catch a grenade for you,
throw my hand on a blade for you.
I'd jump in front of a train for you.
You know I'd do anything for you.
Oh, oh, oh, I would go through all this pain,
take a bullet straight through my brain.
Yes, I would die for you, baby.
But you won't do the same.

No, you won't do the same,
you wouldn't do the same.
Oooh, you'd never do the same,
no, no, no, no, no.
