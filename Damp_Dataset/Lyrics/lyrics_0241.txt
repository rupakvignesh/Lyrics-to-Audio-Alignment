When I met you in the summer,
to my heartbeat sound.
We fell in love,
as the leaves turned brown.
And we could be together, baby,
as long as skies are blue.
You act so innocent now,
but you lied so soon.
When I met you in the summer.
When I met you in the summer,
to my heartbeat sound.
We fell in love,
as the leaves turned brown.
And we could be together, baby,
as long as skies are blue.
You act so innocent now,
but you lied so soon.
When I met you in the summer.
Summer.
When I met you in the summer.
Summer.
